# Mafdet UI

Demo UI app for LocalDev solution. This app is a sort of census for cats (yeah, cats).

`Mafdet` (also Mefdet, Maftet) was a goddess in the ancient Egyptian religion. She was often depicted wearing a skin of a cheetah, and protected against the bite of snakes and scorpions.

## Running app locally (manually)
- install dependencies with `npm install`
- run `npm start` This will start Keycloak docker image (check `keycloak\docker-compose.yml` file) for more details like ports etc.

## Keycloak Users
